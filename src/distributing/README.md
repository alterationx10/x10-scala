This chapter will cover distributing software you've written in Scala. We'll
cover

- how to publish your libraries to Maven Central,
- publish compiled applications to GitHub Releases,
- create Homebrew taps which can be used to compile your application at install
  or downloaded pre-compiled versions from GitHib release
- build Docker images - which we will deploy to Fly.io.
