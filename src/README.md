# INTRODUCTION

This book is a collection of notes, snippets, reminders, etc... about
[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), written by
[me](https://github.com/alterationx10), Mark Rudolph (a.k.a. Alteration x10).
The "X10" in the site name, and libraries published are just a play off my
username.

The content is aiming to be aggregated and presented as a "get started in Scala"
for new-to-Scala developers, geared towards a "build yourself a small
ecosystem", including publishing your own libraries so others can easily use
them, and deploying your own tools and applications. The emphasis will largely
focus on Scala 3 using scala-cli.
