# INTRODUCTION

This book is a collection of notes, snippets, reminders, etc... about
[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), written by
[me](https://github.com/alterationx10), Mark Rudolph (a.k.a. Alteration x10 in
various places on-line). The "X10" in the site name, and libraries published are
just a play off my username.

The content is aiming to be aggregated and presented as a "get started in Scala"
for new-to-Scala developers, geared towards a "build yourself a small
ecosystem", including publishing your own libraries so others can easily use
them, and deploying your own tools and applications. The emphasis will largely
focus on Scala 3 using scala-cli.

I recently saw [Alvin Alexander](https://x.com/alvinalexander) reference a
[tweet](https://x.com/alvinalexander/status/1570469953966424064) with this
useful advice (which I have transcribed/paraphrased from the image):

> Documentation needs to be explicitly structured, and kept separate and
> distinct.

I think this book will contain a variety of these types of content, and I will
do my best to follow this advice, and try to keep the content organized and
structured as such.
