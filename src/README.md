# INTRODUCTION

This book is a collection of notes, snippets, reminders, etc... about
[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), written by
[me](https://github.com/alterationx10), Mark Rudolph (a.k.a. Alteration x10).
The "X10" in the site name, and libraries published are just a play off my
username.

The style is aimed to be a "build yourself a small ecosystem", including
publishing your own libraries so others can easily use them, and deploying your
own applications. The content will largely focus on Scala 3 and scala-cli.
