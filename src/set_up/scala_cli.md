# Scala CLI

[Scala CLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/) is an ambitious new tool for
Scala, that aims to be a batteries-included powerhouse for getting up and
running with the language. It lets you write simple scripts/programs with ease,
and can even manage a decent sized project as a build tool, despite them not
billing it as a build tool. You can easily publish your own libraries -
including GPG signing your artifacts. The list goes on...

Generally, only single module projects are supported at the moment, but we'll
take that as a challenge and see just how much we can build with it!

## Installation

Head over to
[https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/install#advanced-installation](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/install#advanced-installation)
to quickly get up and running with Scala CLI. It will likely already be
selected, but pick your OS and install method, and follow the instructions. (I
use homebrew for MacOS).

They also have a setup action for GitHub Actions, which will come in handy
later!
